# Introduction
With respect to its psychometric properties, what are the characteristics of the most appropriate IRT model for the PAES math M1 assessment? How comparable are information and efficiency across forms based on the most appropriate IRT model?

# Method

## Dataset

## Instrument (forms and some test description)

## Procedure
This study investigated the appropriateness of the 1PL, 2PL and 3PL IRT models.

IRT models (parameters)
Calibration (estimation methods and concurrent calibration - equating)
Absolute model fit assessment
Model comparisons based on test information and reliability. Relative model fit assessment
Forms comparison based on the best-fitting model (comparing test info and relative efficiency)

# Results

Comparison of model results (information, factor scores, SE)
Comparison of forms based on Rasch and 2PL models (information, expected true scores)

# Discussion

# Conclusion
